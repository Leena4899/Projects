# Projects
Retail Dynamics Analysis | SQL and Python 
• Developed a data analysis project using Python and SQL to analyze key retail metrics, providing meaningful business intelligence 
to enhance retail strategies and support data-driven decisions.  
• Used Python Pandas to clean and preprocess retail data, handling missing values and duplicates, and derived new columns for 
profit, sales price, and discount by calculating based on cost, sales values, and discount rules to uncover actionable insights. 
• Utilized SQL to perform in-depth retail analysis, including identifying top 10 revenue-generating products, top 5 best-sellers by 
region, month-over-month sales growth for 2022–2023, peak sales months per category, and highest profit-growing sub
categories year-over-year.
